Soultan is a lightweight, expressive, and processor-friendly software synthesizer built using the HISE framework. It is designed for producers, sound designers, and musicians who want a clean workflow, intuitive controls, and a polished analog-inspired sound. Soultan combines dual oscillators, flexible modulation, detailed EQ, dynamics shaping, and a full effects suite—resulting in a compact but powerful virtual instrument.
